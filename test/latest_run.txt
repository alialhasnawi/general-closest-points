Own Implementation:
1689 euclidean distance calls + 4261 other distance calls = 5950 total calls.
(other distance calls only use abs and subtraction, Minkowski p-> -infinity)
Took 13.932ms.

Normal Implementation (with extra pair checks removed)
499500 euclidean distance calls.
Took 611.955ms.

Generic Implementation (uses built-in sorting, but only works for R2)
2429 euclidean distance calls.
Took 7.49ms.
